# project-audio-interface
For my final project I am making a soundboard on farm animal sounds.
I was influenced by our last lab to create a button that can open or make a popup.
So I decided to write "Meet the Animals" and when you click that it will show a picture of the
animals.
On the audio interactive part.
Whenever the picture of a animal is clicked it will make a noise based on the animal.
